# üóÇÔ∏è My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles managed with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/). I use this configuration to quickly set up my configuration on my machines.

## üíª What are Dotfiles?

Dotfiles are plain text configuration files that control the behavior of shells, editors, version control systems, and other tools on Unix-like systems. Keeping them in a version-controlled repository ensures a consistent environment across devices.
